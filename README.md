# Statistical-Models
## My Statistical Models for Data Science Coursework
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This repo contains my work from the Statistical Models for Data Science course I took at the University of Haifa. <br>
This course emphasized developing statistical modeling skills and the ability to communicate data analysis results clearly and effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. <br>
Each assignment folder is organized to include:
* R code files with all analysis scripts
* Statistical summary report (concise write-ups that explain my methodology and findings)
* Data subfolder containing relevant datasets

### Assignment 1: BMI Analysis from Nutrition Survey (Multiple Linear Regression)
Analysis of USDA nutrition survey data (1995-1996) examining factors influencing BMI:

Data preparation: Merged datasets, handled missing values, assessed transformations
Exploratory analysis: Descriptive statistics and visualizations
Modeling: Multiple linear regression with demographic, dietary, and physical activity predictors
Selection approach: Stepwise procedures with interaction effect evaluation

### Assignment 2: Analyzing Temporal Thinking Patterns (Logistic & Poisson Regression)
Analysis of experience sampling data on "mental time travel" (past/present/future thinking):
Logistic Regression Analysis:
* Examined time-of-day influence on future-oriented thinking
* Compared standard vs. mixed-effects models for nested observations

Poisson Regression Analysis:
* Examined relationships between personality traits and future thinking frequency
* Applied count data modeling with offset terms and overdispersion tests
